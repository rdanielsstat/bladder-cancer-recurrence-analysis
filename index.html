<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="description">Description</h2>
<p>This document presents an analysis of the classic bladder cancer recurrence data. It illustrates advanced statistical approaches to recurrent events survival analysis while demonstrating the use of modern data science tools and workflows, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version control &amp; reproducibility: GitHub, Quarto, Markdown, bibliographic integration</li>
<li>Statistical programming: R</li>
<li>Visualization &amp; reporting: HTML output<br>
</li>
<li>Analytical methods: recurrent events survival analysis</li>
</ul>

<section id="data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h2>
<p>Data are from <span class="citation" data-cites="Byar1977">(<a href="#ref-Byar1977" role="doc-biblioref">Byar &amp; Blackard, 1977</a>)</span>. Per the R survival package <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/survival/man/bladder.html">documentation</a>, the <code>bladder1</code> data set is the full data set. Patients entered the study after removal of superficial bladder tumors. They were randomized into one of three treatment arms and followed for tumor recurrence for up to 64 months. Censoring occurs either at loss to follow-up, death, or end of study. These are interval-level survival data and contain the following variables:</p>
<pre><code>id        : subject ID
treatment : treatment group (placebo, pyridoxine, or thiotepa)
number    : number of initial tumors
size      : size of the largest initial tumor (cm)
recur     : cumulative number of recurrences
start     : start of the interval (0 or previous event time)
stop      : end of interval; recurrence or censoring time
status    : end of interval code
            (0 = censored, 1 = recurrence, 
             2 = death from bladder disease, 
             3 = other death or unknown)
rtumor    : number of tumors at recurrence
rsize     : size of largest tumor at recurrence (cm)
enum      : event number</code></pre>
