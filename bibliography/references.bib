  abstract = {The Cox regression model for censored survival data specifies that covariates have a proportional effect on the hazard function of the life-time distribution of an individual. In this paper we discuss how this model can be extended to a model where covariate processes have a proportional effect on the intensity process of a multivariate counting process. This permits a statistical regression analysis of the intensity of a recurrent event allowing for complicated censoring patterns and time dependent covariates. Furthermore, this formulation gives rise to proofs with very simple structure using martingale techniques for the asymptotic properties of the estimators from such a model. Finally an example of a statistical analysis is included.},

  abstract = {We derive the asymptotic distribution of the maximum partial likelihood estimator β for the vector of regression coefficients β under a possibly misspecified Cox proportional hazards model. As in the parametric setting, this estimator β converges to a well-defined constant vector β*. In addition, the random vector n1/2(β – β*) is asymptotically normal with mean 0 and with a covariance matrix that can be consistently estimated. The newly proposed robust covariance matrix estimator is similar to the so-called “sandwich” variance estimators that have been extensively studied for parametric cases. For many misspecified Cox models, the asymptotic limit β* or part of it can be interpreted meaningfully. In those circumstances, valid statistical inferences about the corresponding covariate effects can be drawn based on the aforementioned asymptotic theory of β and the related results for the score statistics. Extensive studies demonstrate that the proposed robust tests and interval estimation procedures are appropriate for practical use. In particular, the robust score tests perform quite well even for small samples. In contrast, the conventional model-based inference procedures often lead to tests with supranominal size and confidence intervals with rather poor coverage probability.}

    abstract = {The counting process with the Cox-type intensity function has been commonly used to analyse recurrent event data. This model essentially assumes that the underlying counting process is a time-transformed Poisson process and that the covariates have multiplicative effects on the mean and rate function of the counting process. Recently, Pepe and Cai, and Lawless and co-workers have proposed semiparametric procedures for making inferences about the mean and rate function of the counting process without the Poisson-type assumption. In this paper, we provide a rigorous justification of such robust procedures through modern empirical process theory. Furthermore, we present an approach to constructing simultaneous confidence bands for the mean function and describe a class of graphical and numerical techniques for checking the adequacy of the fitted mean–rate model. The advantages of the robust procedures are demonstrated through simulation studies. An illustration with multiple-infection data taken from a clinical study on chronic granulomatous disease is also provided.},

  abstract = {The paper is concerned with the analysis of regression effects when individual study subjects may experience multiple failures. The proposed methods are most likely to be useful when there are a fairly large number of study subjects. Two general classes of regression models are considered in order to relate the hazard or intensity function to covariates and to preceding failure time history. Both models are of a stratified proportional hazards type. One model includes baseline intensity functions that are arbitrary as a function of time from the beginning of study, while the other includes baseline intensity functions that are arbitrary as a function of time from the study subject's immediately preceding failure. Partial likelihood functions are derived for the regression coefficients. Generalizations and illustrations are given.},

 abstract = {Many survival studies record the times to two or more distinct failures on each subject. The failures may be events of different natures or may be repetitions of the same kind of event. In this article, we consider the regression analysis of such multivariate failure time observations. Each marginal distribution of the failure times is formulated by a Cox proportional hazards model. No specific structure of dependence among the distinct failure times on each subject is imposed. The regression parameters in the Cox models are estimated by maximizing the failure-specific partial likelihoods. The resulting estimators are shown to be asymptotically jointly normal with a covariance matrix that can be consistently estimated. Simultaneous inferential procedures are then proposed. Extensive Monte Carlo studies indicate that the normal approximation is adequate for practical use. The new methods allow time-dependent covariates, missing observations, and arbitrary patterns of censorship. They are illustrated with two real-life examples. For recurrent failure time data, various regression methods have been proposed in the literature. These methods, however, generally assume stringent structures of dependence among the recurrences of each subject. Moreover, as shown in the present article, they are rather sensitive to model misspecification.},
